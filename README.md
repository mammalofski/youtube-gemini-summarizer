# YouTube Gemini Assistant

## Description

This Chrome extension adds a button to YouTube video pages. Its main purpose is to help you get the best summary of a video for free. Clicking the button automatically prepares a prompt with the video link, opens Gemini AI in a new tab, and then injects the prompt into Gemini and submits it. This allows you to quickly get a summary and learn what the video has to offer without watching the entire thing or manually copying and pasting.
