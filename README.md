# YouTube Gemini Assistant

## Description

This Chrome extension adds a button to YouTube video pages. Its main purpose is to help you get the best summary of a video for free. Clicking the button copies the video's transcript (if available) to your clipboard and opens Gemini AI in a new tab. You can then paste the transcript into Gemini to get a summary, allowing you to learn what the video has to offer without watching the entire thing.
