# YouTube Gemini Assistant

## Description

This Chrome extension lets you summarize any YouTube video with just a single click using Gemini's native YouTube adapter and LLM capabilities. The extension works in two ways:

1. **Video Watch Page**: Click the "G" button that appears next to the like/dislike buttons on any YouTube video to get a comprehensive summary
2. **Video Thumbnails**: Click the "Ask Gemini" button that appears below video thumbnails on YouTube's home page, search results, and channel pages to instantly summarize videos without opening them first

No need to watch the entire video or manually copy-paste links - the extension handles everything automatically. 

**Note:** You must be logged into your Gemini account for the extension to work properly.
